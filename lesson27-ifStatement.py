### Lesson 27: Python's conditional statements

print("Please log into your account.")

# if statement aka something I'm already very aware of
password = input("Please enter password: ")
if password == "pass":
    print("Access granted! Welcome!")
else:
    print("Error! Incorrect password.")

### I will be skipping around since most of this material is
###     very familiar to me. I have a firm grasp of conditionals
###     and my main goal of these lessons is to learn syntax.
